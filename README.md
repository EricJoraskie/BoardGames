Othello -
The othello game here was a final project for my first course in the Northeastern
ALIGN bridge. It turned out to be pretty good. It is a version of the board game
Othello, which is similar to Reversi, and is run as a Processing Sketch:

If you download processing and run it, you will have the opportunity to play a
relatively formidable computer adversary that I wrote. There is a way to take 
advantage of how the computer chooses it's moves, but you'll have to read the code
to figure it out. I suggest playing it first! Good luck
