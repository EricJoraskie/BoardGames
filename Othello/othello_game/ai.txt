1. Yes, I attempted to make it better than choosing a random legal move.
2. Based on my games against it, I think it's much better than random
    (which is what I had it do while smoothing out game mechanics.)

3. Basically the AI targets key positions on the board,
    starting with the corners as the highest priority, then edge pieces to bait
    the corners, then the corners of the middle square, and lastly
    general edge pieces.
    It also actively avoids placing disks in positions that allow
    it's opponent to take the corners and edge pieces.
    This results in sticking to the middle area as much as possible
    until the edge is available, and avoiding giving up the corners where possible.
    It's not bad. For the amount of time I spent on it, I think it's reasonably challenging

4. Of the three people who tried it that weren't me, two lost and one tied, so there is that.
    It's occasionally smothering and occasionally very beatable, it kind of depends on
    the pick it makes on the random draw.
    I was winning maybe 2/3 of the time, but then I made an adjustment while building the test
    suite for the ai module, and then it crushed me a few games in a row when I wasn't actively
    making good moves. Its possible that it's pretty solid, especially vs naive players.

5. To improve it, I'd probably make it future looking, and include a few more general
    tricks, like minimize pieces captured early, and take bait positions once the corners
    is filled.

Oh, it also talks smack, which I'd probably adjust to be more accurate
    based on how the game is going.
